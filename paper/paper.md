# Introduction

This document reports on the first INTOXICOM Implementation Study workshop series [@citesAsEvidence:INTOXICOM],
held in Utrecht on May 28 and 29 2024 [@citesAsEvidence:Aanmelder]. The topic of
the meeting was the FAIRification of toxicological research output, including how
ELIXIR resources may be able to help here. The meeting was organized by a team
of ten people from the ELIXIR Toxicology Community: Marvin Martens, Penny Nymark,
Iseult Lynch, Meike Bünger, Rob Stierum, Thomas Exner, Egon Willighagen, Ammar Ammar,
Dominik Martinát, and Karel Berka. The target audience of this first INTOXICOM
workshop was toxicologists with an interest in using FAIR data resources for their
research or in making their data (more) FAIR, as well as data managers/stewards
and researchers working with adverse outcome pathways (AOPs).

The workshop included presentations and working sessions around various topics.
The INTOXICOM described the first workshop as having two parts. The first part
of the workshop would focus on applying FAIR solutions to toxicology databases
and datasets. Part of this was describing the use of compact identifiers to link
to specific records in databases in narratives such as project deliverables, e.g.
in PARC [@citesForInformation:PARC].

The second part would focus on Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) in the AOP-Wiki.
The workshop will explore the FAIRification of AOPs and AOP-Wiki, making AOPs
findable in more ways, and continues on the efforts of the CIAO project
([ciao-covid.net](https://ciao-covid.net/)) that assesses the FAIRness of
AOPs [@citesForInformation:CIAO2022]. The output of this part would be the FAIR
Implementation Profile for AOPs. The planned delvierables for the workshop
include: 1. this report; 2. a FAIR Implementation Profile for AOPS; and, 3.
a proposed standard on how to use compact identifiers on project reports.

This report will describe the program of the actually held workshop, link to
presentations (where possible), and discuss the hands-on work done and results
from that.

## The workshop

The workshop was attended in person in Utrecht by 16 people on the first day,
with two people giving an online presentaiton, and X people on the second day.

# Citation Typing Ontology annotation

You can use [CiTO](http://purl.org/spar/cito/2018-02-12) annotations, as explained in [this BioHackathon Europe 2021 write up](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biohackrxiv/bhxiv-metadata/main/doc/elixir_biohackathon2021/paper.md) and [this CiTO Pilot](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/cito).
Using this template, you can cite an article and indicate _why_ you cite that article, for instance DisGeNET-RDF [@citesAsAuthority:Queralt2016].

The syntax in Markdown is as follows: a single intention annotation looks like
`[@usesMethodIn:Krewinkel2017]`; two or more intentions are separated
with colons, like `[@extends:discusses:Nielsen2017Scholia]`. When you cite two
different articles, you use this syntax: `[@citesAsDataSource:Ammar2022ETL; @citesAsDataSource:Arend2022BioHackEU22]`.

Possible CiTO typing annotation include:

* citesAsDataSource: when you point the reader to a source of data which may explain a claim
* usesDataFrom: when you reuse somehow (and elaborate on) the data in the cited entity
* usesMethodIn
* citesAsAuthority
* citesAsEvidence
* citesAsPotentialSolution
* citesAsRecommendedReading
* citesAsRelated
* citesAsSourceDocument
* citesForInformation
* confirms
* documents
* providesDataFor
* obtainsSupportFrom
* discusses
* extends
* agreesWith
* disagreesWith
* updates
* citation: generic citation
